/*
- There are three main numeric types in PHP:

    i. Integer
    ii. Float
    iii. Number Strings

- In addition, PHP has two more data types used for numbers:

    i. Infinity
    ii. NaN

*/
    
// * Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:
$a = 5;
$b = 5.34;
$c = "25";

//* To verify the type of any object in PHP, use the `var_dump()` function:
var_dump($a);
var_dump($b);
var_dump($c);
