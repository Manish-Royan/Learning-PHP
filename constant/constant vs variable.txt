                            Constant vs Variables

[Constant]:
-> Once the constant is defined, it can never be redefined.
-> A constant can only be defined using define() function. It cannot be defined by any simple assignment.	
-> There is no need to use the dollar ($) sign before constant during the assignment.	
-> Constants do not follow any variable scoping rules, and they can be defined and accessed anywhere.	
-> Constants are the variables whose values can't be changed throughout the program.	
-> By default, constants are global.	

[Variables]:
-> A variable can be undefined as well as redefined easily.
-> A variable can be defined by simple assignment (=) operator.
-> To declare a variable, always use the dollar ($) sign before the variable.
-> Variables can be declared anywhere in the program, but they follow variable scoping rules.
-> The value of the variable can be changed.
-> Variables can be local, global, or static.
