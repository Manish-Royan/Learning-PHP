# Learning-PHP

Welcome to the Learning-PHP repository! This repository is part of my study track as a student, where I am learning and practicing PHP, one of the most popular server-side scripting languages for web development.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning progress and provide a comprehensive resource for anyone else who is studying PHP. This repository serves as a personal learning tool to organize my study materials, monitor my progress, and provide a reference for future projects.
