We use 'die' and 'exist' when we ant to terminate or to stop the program execution. Both are kindof same. 

'die' is get from 'perl' programming language. It used most of time to deal with exception.

'exit()' is get from 'C programming Language'. It is used to whenever we want to stop code at certain point.

'return' - it stop the execution within the function not the whole program, but it used to return or get output from a function.
